# Wherefore go-saturate

In my [previous blog post][siginfo], I wrote about a bottleneck I ran
into that caused my application to pause when I felt it should've been
working hard.

My workers were all stuck waiting for data from one source while other
sources of the same data were available.

This is how I fixed it.

# Problems Illustrated

</div>

First, it's good to see exactly what the problem looked like.

There are four workers and they all need a mix of data of type `a` or
`b`.  Both `a` and `b` data sets are replicated so any given record
can come from one of two of these servers.

If there are equal tasks for `a` and `b` and servers are all generally
available, but one of the servers is slower than the others, then you
will invariably end up with one of the workers stuck retrieving data
from `a rep 1` even though `a rep 2` contains the same data.

But why is it it blocked on that node?  Because that node is slow.

When randomly selecting workers and one worker takes considerably
longer to complete its work, you will inevitably be blocked waiting
for slower workers to complete their tasks.

If this isn't intuitive to you, think about it this way:

<div>
  <img src="/images/slowrand.png"
  alt="random slowness" title="random slowness" class="floatleft"/>
</div>

Imagine just two servers containing the same information from which
you randomly choose for any given request.  Let's say one server is 8x
slower than the other.

Assume a reasonable random number generator such that there's a 50%
chance that any given request will be issued against the fast one, and
a 50% chance it will be issued against the slow one.

Now imagine you've got two clients that are wanting to grab a bunch of
data from the two servers.

The scneario illustrated above will occur frequently:

1. Client 1 hits the fast server.
2. Client 2 hits the fast server.
3. Client 1 hits the slow server - is blocked for a while.
4. Client 2 hits the fast server again.
5. Client 2 hits the slow server - all workers are blocked while the
fast server is idle.

Boo.

# What Does go-saturate Do About This?

<div>
  <img src="https://raw.github.com/dustin/go-talks/master/channels/twotier.png"
  alt="double fanout" title="double fanout" class="floatright"/>
</div>

If you can express your work in the form of `task, []resources` pairs,
you can use [go-saturate][go-saturate] to help resolve this type of
problem with a double-fanout as illustrated on the right:

1. The producer adds a task that needs to be performed.
2. The first available worker picks it up and classifies resource
requirements.
3. The first available resource is utilized.

In the illustrated case, workers 1 and 3 are concurrently performing
tasks that need data from `a`.

Internally, the resources are each represented by a channel that has
one or more goroutines servicing it (user-specified).  A resource is
"available" when a worker is idle and just waiting for new work on a
channel.  If the resource is slow, the worker spends more time working
and less time accepting new work (see the red in the sequence diagram
above).

By asking for one of either and choosing the most available resource,
they're able to do their work without blocking on each other.

In a sense, the resources are self-selecting.

<div>
  <img src="/images/cbfsperf.png"
  alt="cbfs perf" title="cbfs perf" class="floatright"/>
</div>

As you can see in the right (a cbfs scenario where one server has
100Mbps ethernet and the others have gig-e), slow resources are still
used, but when a slow resource is being slow and a fast resource is
available, we won't choose the slow one.

In long-running tasks, this is great -- if I can keep all the fast
nodes *and* the slow nodes busy, then I get a little more out of the
network as a whole.

# Other Resources

You can read the [go-saturate docs][docs] to get an overview of the API.

Also, I gave a presentation at work earlier this week on this topic
which goes a lot further into basic go channel semantics interactively
including a range of information from basics like how to send and
receive on a channel to how send a message to exactly one of a
dynamically built set of recipients.

That presentation is captured in the following 20 minute video:

Both the [slides][slides] and the [long-form][article] contents
of the material used in that presentation are available.
