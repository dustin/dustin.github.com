# What I've been Up To - A Virtual Blog Digest

I've been busy doing lots and lots of things.  Much of it is work
related, but I figured I'd quickly dump out a semi-structured list of
things I've been doing since my last post (over three months!)

Many of these things deserve their own blog posts, but since I've
clearly not been doing that, this digest will at least provide
pointers for those interested.

## mccouch

My primary job is to build a better couchbase server.
[mccouch][mccouch] is a key part of that by providing a memcached
binary protocol interface to CouchDB.  Bypassing HTTP and using
memcached multi-set semantics gets us really good throughput for
putting data on disk.

## house temperature readers

<div>

    title="I live here." class="floatright" />
</div>

My thermometers live on a [1-wire bus][ibutton] I wrote a stack and
collector for that sends multicast data around the LAN I pick up from
various things like the app that generates the image to your right.

I wanted to get that data stored into CouchDB, so I wrote a quick
[multicast temperature -> couchdb][tempcoffee] thing in
[coffeescript][coffeescript] for [node.js][nodejs].

There were a couple of aspects of that I didn't like (I think the
primary thing was the VSS on the Linux box I had it deployed), so I
ended up [rewriting it in go][tempgo].  That's been serving me pretty
well.

## couchdb duplicator

In early testing of replicator DB of CouchDB (i.e. playing with it
around the house), I wrote [a quick tool][couchcopy] to have one
CouchDB be a full mirror of another for all existing databases.  I've
got a few big databases.  That was fun.

## complex data-driven couchdb partial replication

I thought it might be fun to replicate my temperature database (~11M
docs at the time) to another database filtered down to only the
documents that met certain criteria specified by the replication
request.  [That worked][alertrep] via a replication document
specification, but backfilling wasn't as fast as I'd like.  I'll need
to do more work here.

## location project

<div>
  <img src="/images/locations-small.png" alt="locations"
    title="Where I go." class="floatright" />
</div>

I created my [location project][location] as a repository of location
data from [google latitude][latitude] and [tripit][tripit].  It
automatically populates itself with data from these sources and will
let me explore my many travels interactively thanks to
[geocouch][geocouch] (my first time using it) and google maps.

As you can see, my many travels are typically to Tahoe and home.

## code review

<div>
  <img src="/images/gerrit-small.png" alt="gerrit"
    title="Our code." class="floatright" />
</div>


I did some work here and there on our [gerrit dashboard][review] thing
that shows what we've been working on.

One somewhat notable thing was switching from gravatar to
[libravatar][libravatar] for the avatars.  Most people probably didn't
notice, but libravatar is pretty cool, and it's got pass-through
compatability.

I've got one of these for [android][androidreview] as well, though
kernel.org's outage has made it pretty stale.

## photo app work

I did a bunch of work on my [photo couchapp][photo].  I use this to
store and replicate all of my photos.  It's probably not exciting to
most people (though everyone's free to use it for a great way to use
the cloud to benefit without dataloss or availability risk).

I made a bulk edit screen and built myself a proxy for accessing the
full-size image I have mirrored onto S3 via a signing proxy redirector
thing to my house.  This is a service I wrote in (I think) python.  I
originally tried to write it in node.js, but I found a bug in the S3
API I was trying to use and just wanted it to work.

## readme

I wrote [this web app][readme] for our support guys to track
discussions of interest from around the web.  Instead of them having
to have duplicate RSS reader config, lots of mail setups and stuff,
they just have one screen they can look at and share and track state
of all the things they need to respond to.

(and sorry, the app doesn't have a README, if anyone's interested, I
can start documenting it)

## reddit pics

Another tiny app I wrote just for me, my [reddit pics app][rpics]
presents me with a stream of images from reddit and lets me mark the
ones I want to keep, while deleting the rest.

(well, deleting in this case means removing from my local DB which is
a replicate of an upstream master DB that keeps All The Things)

## gomemcached update

Someone filed a bug report against my [go memcached
server][gomemcached] that involved little more than an update for a
newer compiler, but that was fun to play with again.

## gotap

I don't even remember why, but I wrote an implementation of the
memcached tap protocol [in go][gotap].  This is the protocol upon
which we build replication, failover, ETL, etc... in membase.

## html5 page idle stuff

HTML5 added a feature that allows you to detect when the browser
renders your page hidden (most commonly by switching tabs).  This is
really awesome for things like [my code review][review] and
[reddit][rpics] apps since I can disable the realtime data stream to
pages that aren't even being looked at (and enable it when someone
looks again!)

## web de-auth proxy

I did some private use map visualizations use google maps (which
[Volker Mische][volker] ported to the jquery openmap API).
Unfortunately, they also used private databases and running a web
screen saver or full-time web browser that requires auth can be a
minor annoyance.

That sounded like a great job for [node.js][nodejs], so I wrote a
quick [deauthing proxy in node.js][deauthnode] using the built-in http
server, client, and a pipe.  It was a bit more complicated than I
initially assumed it would be, but that was basically it.

Unfortunately, it was very unreliable.  Not sure if my bug, or
node.js, but after a few minutes, it'd stop answering any HTTP
requests, or even acknowledging that it received one.  That kind of
sucked.

So I wrote [a new one in go][deauthgo].  It's the same number of lines
(once I added commandline parsing and stuff), but has worked
flawlessly since I deployed it even with a bunch of concurrent clients
grabbing lots of data and long-polling and what-not.

## fprof visualization

<div>
  <img src="/images/fprof-dot-small.png" alt="fprof visualization"
    title="There's more where this came from." class="floatright" />
</div>

Part of our ongoing effort of performancing everything involves
understanding everything.  I did a little bit of stuff with a [tiny
module][erlanglive] or [two][euserdefault] showing me the current state
of things, but that really didn't help understanding things moving
forward.

My first pass at this was to understand the data produced by [Erlang's
fprof][fprof] and organize it into a giant document we can pan and
trace and see where things are unnecessarily hot and why.  I wrote [my
fprof dot][fprofdot] thing to do that work.  It's not quite
productionalized, but it's worked well for me.

## web pipe

Turns out, graphviz from homebrew is broken on Lion (one of the
relatively few issues I've run into), and I wanted to be able to look
at stuff I was building, so I made a little [web pipe][webpipe] tool
that let me have processes that run on remote machines take data from
stdin and pass it back to stdout on my local machine using curl and
node.js.  That worked pretty well.

## erlang dtrace

This definitely deserves a post by itself, but in the meantime, I've
been working to add proper dtrace support to erlang (once and for
all!)

I mentioned my first attempt with fprof above.  There was a second
attempt at digging out enough information where I used the low-level
tracing facilities of erlang itself to really understand where
everything was happening.  It will really tell you a lot, but you have
to write a lot of tools and really just end up doing it yourself.

So then came [dtrace][dtrace].

Anyone who knows dtrace will understand this, and anyone who knows me
will have heard it all (all!) before, but dtrace answers all the
questions.  Life, the universe, everything.

A co-worker asked me how long it takes for a message sent from one
erlang process to be picked up in another process.  Without as much as
picking up an editor, I blasted out [this commandline][emsgtime] and
was able to say it's around 8µs ± a few nanoseconds for clock skew
across cores and processes that are scheduled independently on other
threads regardless of my message having been sent.

My [DTrace wiki page][erlangd] is a starting point for getting the
stuff going and knowing where all the probes are (basically
function/bif/nif entry/return, process scheduler events, gc events,
allocation events, message sending, hibernate, probably more).

It makes it really easy to test things that are just invisible to
erlang itself -- like knowing which erlang functions cause heap growth
that directly causes the OS itself to actually `mmap`/`sbrk` in more
memory since it all correlates.

You, too, can know it all.

## lua (again)

Way back in October of last year I started experimenting with
server-side scripting in membase.  I spent a bit of time a couple of
weeks ago and actually got a pretty rich set of APIs and stuff built
and was able to demo complex server-side manipulation and batch
processing with a dynamically extensible client.

There were lots of fun challenges inside of this (e.g. multiple
threads operating on lua concurrently while being able to define
global functions available to all future sessions while blocking
accidental global variable definition).  I'm hoping to get it into
some products as a way to enhance testing and more quickly extend
client functionality (though ideally users won't even know about it).

Glue code can be a lot of fun.  I've really got a lot more to say
about this one, too.

## couchconf

I did a CouchConf talk on jQuery in San Francisco.  There are a [lot
more coming][couchconfses], so I might be doing more of this on
different topics very soon.

For this one, I did a bunch of prep work, thought about what I was
going to do, etc...  Then I threw it all away and finalized my
presentation with [prezi][ccprezi].

I wanted to demo some of the stuff I was talking about, so I thought
of something new and literally [wrote the app][bitcoinapp] on the ride
up to the show (and kept enhancing it until my talk).

The app itself isn't that exciting -- it shows realtime trades of
bitcoin across all exchanges (data populated by [a little go
app][btcloader] that I threw together to replace a python one I didn't
like).

## git tree hash based positive test result memoization

I can't remember what I was doing, but it involved running a bunch of
tests with [git test sequence][gittest] and they weren't fast enough.
Someone had given me some memoization code a while back, but it was
commit based and used refs and I think it lacked a bit of perfection.

To speed up my testing on an evolving tree, I [updated
it][githashmemo] to record successful test results by the test issued
and the tree hash into the object store directly.  This means there
are dangling objects that will eventually be cleaned up, but this is
going to happen around the time that you don't care about those tests
results anyway, so it's perfect.

Everyone:  abuse the git object store to make your lives better.

## leveldb - first impressions

Somewhere along the way, I wrote a backend for membase that stores
data in [leveldb][leveldb].  It's a lot of fun to work with, and as
you can see in [my results][leveldbfi], it's up to 10x faster than
our highly tuned SQLite on inserts on SSD (less on EC2, but that's
OK).  It's certainly more consistent.

It's not *perfect*, though.  It's not really any faster on fetches or
commits (sometimes a lot slower) and I've got [one crashing
bug in leveldb][leveldbbug], that I need to get out of the way before
I can even show it to anyone.

## the programming challenge

I got to review some code from a candidate a few times for a fairly
simple "let me see your handwriting" kind of coding question we pass
around.

The basic problem involves reading a file with a bunch (~1M) usernames
into a structure in memory and providing a function to tell you
whether a given user is in it.

Candidates invariably want to build something like a trie, but often
fall into this trap where they believe pointers don't take up space
(even arrays of pointers, apparently).  I wanted to give it a go, so I
did a plain C implementation that ended up being fewer lines of code
than what we'd got from our candidates, used about 10% of the memory
and ran many times faster.

I sucked some other people's time into this as well.  If you'd like to
offer a suggestion, [here's a tool][challenge] that generates 100M
usernames for you to try out.  (finally got to use a bloom filter,
yay!  (and no, the answer doesn't involve a bloom filter unless you
want to do a times/space tradeoff thing)

If you want to try it, note that my program is < 100 lines of plain C
(no external libraries) and uses 1.26GB of RAM on my macbook for
100,000,000 usernames.  It loads and indexes them in 84 seconds and
spends another 31 seconds verifying it can find each of the
100,000,000 users within that list (+ 4 more that are known to not be
there).  Please do better than that.

## program like a pirate

I've written a couple thousand lines of [R][r] in the last month or
so.

Here are some examples taken completely out of context.  I also owe a
blog post on how incredibly easy it is to just throw all your data
into CouchDB and then look at it with R.

## python heatmap

Some of my visualization work wasn't just couchdb -> R to pdf or png
or something, but I wanted to do some slightly different stuff.

As part of my upcoming [pycodeconf][pycodeconf] talk on
[breakdancer][breakdancer], I wanted to come up with some
visualization on what it looked like for a cluster of tests to fail
out of a 130k test suite in a way that might be consumable by a
human.  For this, I grabbed a [python heatmap][pyheatmap]
implementation and hacked on it a bit to do what I wanted.

Well, that didn't work for me all that well, but it did get me
interested in doing an interactive heatmap animation of geographical
density data changing over time, so I ended up doing that instead and
updating the library a little bit to do it.  That was more
successful.

## couchdb wikipedia

Over the weekend, I loaded all of wikipedia (2011-09-01) into a
couchdb and added a geo index over all of the features I could find
that reference a "place."  It's pretty fun to look around and find
articles by bounding box.  It's also pretty decently fast to see the
r-tree go with a bit over 300,000 points across the world.

Hopefully, I'll end up making an offline wikipedia at some point, but
I've got a lot of projects lined up ahead of this.

# ...but mostly

It's been customer and product work.  I've got a variety of really
interesting problems at customer sites (e.g. a 100 microsecond SLA for
one, high volume realtime data analysis across many dimensions for
another).

We're continuing to define and build [UnQL][unql] for everybody and
attending and hosting lots of talks all over the place.  I hope to see
you at some of them.

(and if you program in C, C++, objective C, java, go, erlang,
javascript, R, ruby, and/or python and want to help use and build some
awesome technologies, I could use some help)
