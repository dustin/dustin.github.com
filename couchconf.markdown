Come join me at [Couchconf SF][conf] to talk about cool technology and
things we build with it.  I build all kinds of things out of all kinds
of things, but especially like the motivation I get from hearing about
other people's projects.

There's still time to register, so head over to the [Couchconf
SF][conf] reg page and use the promo code &ldquo;`dustin`&rdquo; for a
discount (the faceless form version of "tell 'em I sent ya").

I'm also planning to attend the [big data hackathon][hack] the day
after.  I've got some neat projects lined up with friends that I think
will be quite cool.
